Inheritance : where a child class inherits properties and methods from parent(super ) class using the extends keyword
              and it enables code reuse , hierarchical structure and also support polymorhism.
              
Types of Inheritance:
a) Single INheritance : one child(sub or derived class) and one parent(super ,base class)

for eg :  class Father{}     ,   class Child extends Father {}
b) Multilevel Inheritance : one child class extends one base class and then the another child class extends the child class

for eg :  class Father{}   , class Child extends Father{} ,   class GrandChild extends Child{}

c) Multiple Inheritance ( which is implemented via Interface) --  one class can implements two interfaces

for eg:   interface Operations{} , interface Execution{}   ,  class MainProgram implements Operations, Execution

* Second ex. is not possible :  class Father{}   , class Child extends Father{} ,   class GrandChild extends Father , Child 
* Third  ex. is possible : class Father{}   , interface Operations{} ,   class Child extends Father implements Operations {}
* Fourth ex. is not possible : class Father{}   , interface Operations{} ,   class Child implements Operations extends Father {}
* Fifth  ex. is possible:   interface Operations{} , interface Execution extends Operations{}   

d) Hierarchical Inheritance  : --  When multiple subclasses extending one same Parent 

for eg :  class GrandFather{}   , class Father extends GrandFather{} ,   class Child extends GrandFather{}

e) Hybrid Inheritance  --- Mix of types  eg : Hierarchical + interface based multiple inheritance

Super keyword is used in inheritance generally 
1. Super keyword is used to access the parent class fields or methods when overridden in child class  (super.field or super.method() you are calling in child  class of base class)
2. Super keyword  must be the first statement in the subclass constructor if used.
3. A subclass inherits only non-private or protected members of a base class.
4. super can't be used in static context.
